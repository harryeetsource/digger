Dump processes identified as suspicious to disk. Identify suspicious memory regions based on protections (RWX or RX regions that do not map to a file on disk should be detected as suspicious and subsequently the processes should be dumped to disk). Download symbol files from the microsoft symbol server if they are needed for scanning.  Scan all processes for suspicious indicators, regardless of the name. Ensure that processes that are suspended will have their memory dumped to disk automatically, ensure that the program can read the PEB and use stackwalk to determine if the process is calling suspicious APIs, and if suspicious APIs are detected, it should be logged, followed by a memory dump of the process with handles to this suspicious API call. Ensure that the program does not scan itself, and does not duplicate memory dumps. The program should skip reading the PEB and using stackwalk if the process memory was already dumped
